      // do-while loop, this loop is useful when we want to execute the code inside loop for at least one time

      // entry control loops, when we check condition before entering loop execution block then it is called entry control loop.

      // exit control loops, when we check condition after executing  loop execution block then it is called entry control loop, this ensures we execute the code at least one time because first time we run the code without checking condition.

      // do while loop is example of exit control loop whereas for and while loop are example of entry control loop
